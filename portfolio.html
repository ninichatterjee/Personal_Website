                    <p class="experience-meta">Actua | Summer 2024</p>
                    <p>This summer, I had the profound opportunity to serve as a Workshop and Camp Outreach Instructor with Actua, journeying through some of Canada's most remote and awe-inspiring regions. From the northern expanses of Iqaluit, Arctic Bay, Resolute Bay, Grise Fiord, and Pond Inlet in Nunavut, to the vibrant communities of Ulukhaktok, Sachs Harbour, Paulatuk, Tuktoyaktuk, Aklavik, and Inuvik in the Northwest Territories, my experience was both enriching and enlightening.</p>
                    <p>In my role, I delivered engaging STEM workshops in schools and facilitated dynamic summer camps for children aged 5-12. The enthusiasm and curiosity of the young participants were incredibly rewarding, and it was a privilege to contribute to their learning and growth.</p>
                    <p>Beyond my work, I had the honor of connecting with local elders and community members, deepening my understanding of their rich cultural heritage and contemporary challenges. I also had the opportunity to explore traditional foods, such as candied fish, pipsi (smoked fish), maktak (beluga whale meat), caribou stew, bannock, and Uqsuk (whale oil), which offered a window into the cultural practices of the North.</p>
